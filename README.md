### Project Vision
The Supply Chain Tracker is a blockchain-based smart contract designed to streamline and enhance the transparency of product tracking in supply chains. By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, this contract allows for the creation, transfer, and management of products, ensuring that each product's journey is securely and immutably recorded. This system aims to provide businesses and consumers with a reliable and transparent way to monitor product status, ownership, and location throughout the supply chain.
